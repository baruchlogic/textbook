# **A Common Sense Introduction to Logic**

# Introduction

This text was written for an introductory logic course at Baruch College, City University of New York. One goal of this text is to explain the core concepts behind propositional symbolic logic in terms that are as *informal* and conversational as possible. Given that logic is a predominantly formal field of inquiry, this might seem like a strange approach. However, formalism can be daunting to many students. Formal methods are meant to impart clarity and precision into a given discourse - but for many students, if they are presented with formal explanations right off the bat, it can often have the opposite effect. This is rather an abuse of formalism, and an obstacle to clarity and understanding.

We do not believe that it is necessary to sacrifice rigor or accuracy in order to present this material in accessible terms. However, unlike many texts in symbolic logic, formal definitions and theorems are *not* the primary focus of this text. Of course, given that this this text covers *symbolic* logic, we cannot do away with formalism. But it's crucial that the formalism be genuinely *understood*, and not merely memorized by rote.

Hence, we believe that an intuitive understanding of logic and logical concepts is as important for students as, e.g., their ability to memorize natural deduction inference rules.
